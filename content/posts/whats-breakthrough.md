**TLDR;** 'Breakthrough' is a website made by me to write out my thoughts


## Aim

> “You cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore.” -- William Faulkner 

I have tried a lot of methods to deliver the work I do as a programmer and Linux enthusiast. Unfortunately, none of them worked for me. It may be because I suck at editing videos or I don't own the proper pieces of equipment 😐

And so, **blogging was the next best thing** going for me. And I can get some valuable experiences too...

## What is to be expected in the future?

Well, expect some **technical/privacy-related posts** and even some of my thoughts! 😉

Going forward, I would love to improve this site (currently it looks too plain) and be more active in blogging (hopefully 😅)

Do you have some suggestions regarding content/website? Message me on Instagram!
