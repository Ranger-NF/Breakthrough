Browsing on the internet has become an integral part of life and as far as I know, google is the only search engine for many. Similarly, Google Chrome is the go-to browser.

And you know I'm gonna introduce you to the [alternates]()

## Introducing Startpage

[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/en/about-us) is a private search engine that gives almost the same search results as that of Google, without recording all your _weird_ searches. 

Startpage has been my default search for almost a year now! And I love it. For me it just works the best, being fast and responsive while still being secure

Now there are alternatives available mainly [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) but I feel it's a bit sluggish...
Other search engines are covered deeply by [itsfoss](https://itsfoss.com/privacy-search-engines/)!

## Replacing chrome

I always hated Google Chrome because it's a bit of a memory hog, and adding to the hate, their ridiculous [anti-competitive policies tied with YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4gXhmzQztE) and plenty more...

As I searched for the best alternative, I used [Brave]() and my current daily driver [Firefox]().

Why Firefox? Well, because of [Chromimum's]() (The engine of Google Chrome and Brave) monopoly and its connection with, you guessed it, Google. I strongly believe monopoly is always bad, it gives the company the flexibility to do anything without the fear of losing profits (overly-simplified perspective). There are many more reasons like manifest V3, which would exceed the scope of this blog.

Long story short, I personally dislike Google.

Just like Search engines, there are numerous alternatives available, refer [itsfoss's comparison of browsers](https://itsfoss.com/best-browsers-ubuntu-linux/) (It includes Chrome & Chromium + some may not be available to all platforms).

## Winding up

Securing your browsing data for yourself is the first of many steps for a private internet life. Remember you will never be truly private on the internet, it's the struggle to be so that makes a difference!
